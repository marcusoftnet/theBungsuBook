# The Rebuild

## Abstract
Here I will tell the story about how we went about working out a strategy to take us "out of the crisis" using some simple lean and agile practices. This section will also tell the story about the slow but steady progress will be shown and the changes we made to the strategy and our ways of working. There will be recollection of the first ever "Motivational speech" I gave and how that *actually* (?) changed the ways and behavior in the hospital - to my big surprise.

This chapter is probably pretty long, more like a section maybe, and might be broken out to more than one chapter later.
