# The disaster

## Abstract
In this chapter I will tell the story about the big disaster that happened in the hospital, loosing ca 70% of their beds (aka possibility to make money). At the same time they didn't have the a valid operational permit, they underpaid their staff and even before the disaster the didn't make enough money.

There will also be a section in which I will set the stage, shortly (5-6 pages), tell about the people involved and what I did there. Also a little bit about the history.
