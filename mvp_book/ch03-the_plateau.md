# The plateau

## Abstract
This chapter will describe how we lost track of the real reason for running the hospital, started to focus on details (that was easy to do) instead of solving the real underlying problems (that is harder), and how this led to a decline in both quality and quantity. There will be display of bad coaching from me. 

This chapter is shorter again, since there was not much really happening during this period. It was more like declining and sliding away from the good practices we had started

## Topics taught/talked about in this chapter

* Change is the only constant
    - Never stop evolving is hard
    - Coaching is often needed to push further
* Structure and framework for effective work
    - The daily meetings (news here) and keeping them on track
    - We talked about practicalities and not the real problems
    - Blame (and improve) processes not people
* Measurements

    - who should act when we never reach our goal
* Goal-driven turned into task driven
    - What, Why, Definition of Done, To tomorrow
    - Too long feedback loops ("Get accreditation" on the board for 6 months)
