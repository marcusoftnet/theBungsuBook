# The emergency

## Abstract
As the decline continue, inevitable, and funnily almost exactly one year after the first disaster, a second emergency arose. Here the story will reveal how I needed to tell the hospital (that again was not earning enough to cover their costs on a monthly basis) that they 1) Needed to increase their costs, 2) Needed, yes in fact, to lower their incomes. I will also relate the how we managed to pull that off in less than 2 months. Just by refocusing
