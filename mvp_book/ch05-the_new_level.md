# The new level

## Abstract
The last section is about what is happening now. This is our new way of managing, the story of Ibu Elsye will be told, our new "balanced" measurements will be described as well as our guidelines for measurements going forward. I will also describe how we are using the scientific method to have a "hypothesis driven business" that now talks about experiments rather than tasks. 

This chapter is a not very long and will contain some wishes and hopes. It will serve like a little guide for the hospital going forward.
